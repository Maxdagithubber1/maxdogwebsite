<h1>Dog List</h1>
<p>Until around 15,000 years ago, dogs were simply a part of the wolf family. Early man sensed their ability to interpret their wants and desire to please, began to tame and then breed them and thus created man’s best friend – the dog.
 
They say that dogs do not have the intellect of even donkeys however their intelligence at interpreting human behaviour saw them excel. 
From here different breeds of dogs were created for different working needs and then to the companion class that they mostly are today. 
 
Today we have created over 400 breeds and these are sorted into the following groups</p>
<ul>
 <li>Sporting</li>
 <li>Working</li>
 <li>Herding</li> 
 <li>Hunting</li>
 <li>Toy</li>
</ul>
